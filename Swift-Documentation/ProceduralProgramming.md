Does the language support procedural programming?

Swift does support procedural programming. In a purely procedural style, data tends to be highly decoupled from the functions that operate on it.

A procedural language is a type of computer programming language that specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures within its programming context to compose a program. It contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a computational task or program. C is a good example of this. 

Swift can optioinally be written in the procedural style.
