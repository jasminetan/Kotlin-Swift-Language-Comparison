Unlike Swift, Kotlin does not implement memory management itself. Instead, it relies on the architecture on which it's running to handle memory management and garbage collections. This architecture is usually some kind of virtual machine, often the JVM, but with the release of Kotlin/Native, a developer can run Kotlin as a native binary on any architecture they wish.
