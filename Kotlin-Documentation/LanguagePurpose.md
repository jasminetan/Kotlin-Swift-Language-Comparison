Why was the language created?
What problems was the language trying to address?
Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?


Kotlin was developed by JetBrains to solve internal development problems within the company, later, it would become open sourced. The problems it was trying to address was creating a langauge that would still be compatible with Java code, fast compile time, improved version of Scala+C#+Java. They wanted a modern lannguage that would be quick to code with fast compile time to improve workflow. This langauge was a replacement for Java.
